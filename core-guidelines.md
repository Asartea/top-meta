Anything that is small to medium that is brought up during a monthly meeting can be decided upon. Anything large, must have an agenda item to have been decided in a meeting.

In general, disagreement at a lower level would escalate an item to the next level. So, if something is considered a small impact no-vote item, but concerns about it are brought up in chat.. Simply escalate it to medium and call a vote.

A core Member’s judgement should be used and considered when selecting a level. if a proposer calls something medium-impact, but someone else suggests that they would feel more comfortable escalating it.we should default to escalating.
