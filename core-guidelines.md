# Core Expectations

## Remain active 

Stay up-to-date with changes that affect any one, but not necessarily all, of the various topics that comprise The Odin Project
- TOP-meta contribution and tracking
- Repositories under the TOP umbrella
- Infrastructure that runs TOP
- Relationships with benefactors/stakeholders (e.g. Thinkful)
- Core and maintainer channels on the server
- Major curriculum changes
- Votes
- Meetings
- Initiatives (Fireside chat, TOPathons, gamejams)

## Maintenance of the platform
- Curriculum contributions, edits, changes, PR review, and helping drive contributors all fall under this umbrella
- Core members should follow the maintainer guidelines for contributions, with relaxed requirements to spend time on initiatives
- Some core members may have specializations that bend this guideline at times, though, contributing to top-meta is still a requirement
- Maintenance can mean community events (TOPathons, game-jams, Fireside chats), design/UX, and other items like social media

## Communication    
- Communicate absences. For different reasons, related to work, studies, family, etc. there will be periods of time where a Core member can not commit to the demands of TOP and its community, either as much as one would like or as much as is needed. However, this should be the exception, not the rule.
- Propose changes to function or form of The Odin Project
  - Curriculum Changes
  - Moderation strategy
  - Site functionality
  - Initiatives (e.g. Gamejams, TOPathons, Fireside chats)
  - Etc.
- Communications should happen on a semi-regular cadence

## Make informed decisions
- Everybody is expected to vote
- Some things may not have any guidelines
- Use the voting system in place

## Adhere to the social contract

## Be a leader
- Continue to do everything in your ability within reason to improve and maintain the quality of the platform for the end-user with respect to the time and efforts of those maintaining the platform.

## Etc.
Anything that is small to medium that is brought up during a monthly meeting can be decided upon. Anything large, must have an agenda item to have been decided in a meeting.

In general, disagreement at a lower level would escalate an item to the next level. So, if something is considered a small impact no-vote item, but concerns about it are brought up in chat.. Simply escalate it to medium and call a vote.

A core Member’s judgement should be used and considered when selecting a level. if a proposer calls something medium-impact, but someone else suggests that they would feel more comfortable escalating it.we should default to escalating.
