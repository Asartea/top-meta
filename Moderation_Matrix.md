Zaps decay at a rate of 1 zap per week. 

Repeated offenses with unexpired "zaps" increase to the next penalty tier. E.g. The second time a user is warned about unsolicited pings or DMs, they earn 5 zaps instead of 2, making them 3 zaps away from a ban.

This is not a comprehensive list and zaps are at the discretion of the moderation team. Please DM @ModMail if you would like to discuss this matrix or any moderation activity (whether you are on the receiving end or not).
