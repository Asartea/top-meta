# Moderation Matrix
This matrix correlates with the [Community Rules](https://www.theodinproject.com/community_rules) that are required to be followed in order to participate in the community. Some rules have different levels of severity, so you may see references to them under different numbers of zaps. 

This matrix is not all encompassing and zaps are given at the discretion of the moderator team.

## 0 Zaps (Heads Up)
- Dog piling/short circuiting a teaching moment
- Asking about or encouraging the use of Windows
- "Chat bombing", aka posting many short (ususally 4-5 or fewer words) messages in rapid succession, repeatedly sending parts of thoughts (incomplete, non-standalone sentences or fragments) in new messages. (Use shift + enter and send ONE message where possible or edit your message) 
- Discussing mental health issues in depth


## 1 Zap (WARNING) 
Minor violations such as:
- "Mini-modding"
  - Please leave moderation action to the moderators, use ModMail to report rule breaking or if you see something youâ€™re unsure about in the community
- Asking about topics or projects unrelated to The Odin Project 
-Mild unprofessionalism:
  - Drug related conversation 
  - Treating others on the server disrespectfully
  - Mental health issues discussion 
  - Relationship advice
- A second infraction of any 0 Zap issues above

## 2 Zaps (WARNING)
Medium severity violations such as: 
- Suggesting piracy (Rule 9)
- Unsolicited pings/DM/friend request (Rule 6)
- Political or religious topics (Rule 8)
- Mild toxicity (directed insults, provoking/baiting other users, passive aggression, naming & shaming) (Rule 7)
- Self promo without permission (ask with Modmail)(Rule 7)
  - Do not share resources you have created solely for personal or monetary gain
  - Examples: "Fill out my survey" (does not help the goals of Odin), "Join my boot camp/program/server" (Could mislead learners), "Why PHY is superior" (unrelated blog post)

## 5 Zaps
High severity violations such as: 
- Posting about any illegal activities, such as facilitating piracy (Rule 7 and 9)
- Publicly arguing about receiving moderation activity after being asked to take it to ModMail/discuss privately 
- Excessive toxicity (targeted harassment, inciting drama, aggressively arguing purposefully, etc.) (Rule 7)

## 10 Zaps (Immediate Ban)
Extreme severity violations such as: 
- Bigotry (racism, homophobia, hate speech etc)
- Harassment 
- NSFW Imagery
- Spamming 
  - Discord Nitro spam
  - Self promotion (joining just to promote material, no prior chat history)
  - Repeated random nonsensical messages (copypasta)
- Doxxing 
- Any other behavior deemed unacceptable and deserving of a ban by the moderation team

Zaps decay at a rate of 1 zap per week. E.g., if you receive 5 zaps on a Friday, the following Friday you will have 4, the Friday after that you will have 3, and so forth. This means higher level infractions may impact your ability to participate for a longer period of time if further rules are broken. 

Repeated offenses with unexpired "zaps" increase to the next penalty tier. E.g. The second time a user is warned about unsolicited pings or DMs, they earn 5 zaps instead of 2, making them 3 zaps away from a ban.

This is not a comprehensive list and zaps are at the discretion of the moderation team. Please DM @ModMail if you would like to discuss this matrix or any moderation activity (whether you are on the receiving end or not).
