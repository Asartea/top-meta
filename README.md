# The Odin Project Meta

The Odin Project Meta is a repository where we attempt to provide more transparency into the work done by the Core and Maintainers. 

Even though most of interactions TOP learners might have with the maintainers is through our Discord server, there is a lot more work that happens behind the scenes. 

As volunteers, our time is limited, and we borrow that time from our personal passions to help each person that comes through The Odin Project Curriculum. 

We use [the Meta Project Board](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/projects/1) to keep track of backlog of ideas as well as work that is in progress. The items we keep an eye on there are more complex and comprehensive in scope, and usually impact TOP in major ways. For example, TOP Meta is how we brainstormed and broke down the deliverables for the updated HTML/CSS course.  

We hold monthly "stand ups" where we discuss and prioritize work from the backlog, and then it becomes a separate project that rolls up to this repository.



## FAQ

**Q:** Are issues in TOP Meta available for anyone to contribute?  
**A:** No, but if you're interested, please reach out to a maintainer. The work items in TOP Meta require quite a bit more experience and we want to make sure we don't set up anyone to fail.

**Q:** Can I leave feedback on issues that I see in TOP Meta?  
**A:** As valuable as that is, please refrain from doing so, and instead continue submitting suggestions in other repos. Or, reach out to a maintainer in Discord.
