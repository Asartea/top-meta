# Chat Moderators
_This document will serve as the entry point to chat moderation in The Odin Project's Discord community for any new Core, Maintainers, and Moderators._

## Purpose of Moderator Role

Moderators are representatives of The Odin Project's community who assist with moderating the official Discord server.

### Admission and Removal of Role

Moderators, and those wishing to be considered for the Moderator role, are expected to have a history of regular and positive contributions to The Odin Project Discord community. Chat moderators are members of the community that illustrate and personify what it means to create a positive impact by abiding by the rules, extending help to others in regards to the community,  having a willingness to hold both themselves and others accountable within the community, and motivating others to create a positive environment.

Removal of the role is subject to the discretion of the Core team members and may occur for any reason, including but not limited to: violation of the rules, abuse of power, etc.

## Chat Responsibilities and Guidelines

### Maintain, follow, and enforce rules

- As a moderator, you will be expected to **adhere to** and **uphold** the rules as detailed and maintained in the `#rules` channel in the Discord at all times. 
- **Kick users from the discord**
    - Primarily, due to the inability to adhere to the rules.
    - Users within the community, should be met with a warning first.
    - Exercise 'common sense' discretion when deciding whether to exercise this power.
    - Kick clear phishers and spammers immediately
    - Rules are meant to be relaxed, with the exception of **overt** usage of hate speech, racism, or pornography. 
    
- **Application of the `loki?` role for rule-breakers and "stern" warnings** (see: `#i-didnt-read-the-rules`)
    - The `loki?` role removes a user's permissions such that they can only view the `#i-didnt-read-the-rules` channel.
    - We apply this role to users who we wish to have a private conversation with, away from the rest of the community. This channel is public to other members of the team for transparency and is where engagements regarding the rules or general chat conduct should occur, as opposed to direct messages.
    - Be mindful that the chat history is not preserved from the user perspective. If a user goes offline, when they return the chat history will be removed from their perspective, potentially requiring us to screenshot prior history.
    - A user can regain their access on their own by acknowledging the rules in the `#rules` channel. Be mindful of this possibility when having engagements.
    - Abuse of the bot should result in the assignment of the `NOBOT` role, which will result in the `odin-bot` ignoring any bot commands made by the user.
- **`Delete` messages from all channels and threads.**
    - Use discretion.
    - Screenshot all messages to be deleted and post them in the `#chat-moderation` channel.
    - Immediately delete content that breaks rules regarding hate speech, racism, and pornography. 
    - Use discretion within reason regarding "bad etiquette"
    - Malicious messages should be deleted.
        - e.g. If somebody is attempting to get somebody to run `rm -rf /`
        - Somebody is looking for help with "phishing" or other illegal activities.
        - Potentially warrants a `loki?` before continuing the user's participation in the community.
- **`Change Nickname` permissions.**
    - User nicknames _should_ adhere to our rules.
    - Overtly hateful, racist, or sexual names are not tolerated.
    - If possible, change the user's name.
    - Abuse of this permission will not be tolerated.
    
### Ban permissions
- Core and Maintainers have the ability to ban users from the community.
- If a chat moderator comes across an offense that warrants a ban, contact any available Core or Maintainer to execute the required ban.
