# The Missing Moderator README
*This document is a compilation recommendations which might assist the transition of a community member becoming a moderator for The Odin Project's Discord community.*

## Why does this exist

This piece of documentation exists to serve two purposes:
1. Cover the nontechnical, interpersonal issues which might arise in moderation.
1. Provide suggestions meant to increase longevity of moderators within their role. 

### Burnout

Try to keep the following in mind.

1. Be mindful of your feelings. If you feel like moderation is becoming a chore, express this to your team and discuss what you can do to feel better - whether that's taking a small break, moderating less, or approaching moderation differently.
1. Don't watch over the channels like a hawk waiting for things to go wrong. Don't feel like you have to moderate every negative server interaction. *Moderate in moderation*. Find a balance in your life, in and outside of the server. Set rules for yourself to stay healthy, happy, and stick to those rules. 
1. This should go without saying but is worth re-iterating: you're not alone, there's nothing to prove, and there's an entire team here to support you. Take time easing into your new role, and lean on your team for support.
1. At the end of every week make some time to take a step back and assess how the week of moderation went for you. How are you feeling? Have you been moderating less than usual or more than usual? Are there things you're proud of?
1. Encourage yourself and your fellow moderators to take more breaks. Your health and happiness always come first before moderation. 
1. Say thank you. Show appreciation for your fellow moderators, these two small words can make a big difference in a person's day.

### Guidelines for moderation

The following are some general guidelines which can help make moderation simpler, easier, and less stressful. 

1. Don't be afraid to keep interactions brief, simple, and to the point. 
1. When moderating don't be vague or open-ended. Be explicit about the rules being broken and in what way they're being broken. 
1. When uncertain if you should be kinder or harsher, lean towards kinder and ask your fellow moderators for feedback on the situation before continuing. 
1. If a conversation isn't going the way you want it to or you find yourself getting upset, ask for help from your fellow moderators. 
1. If you find yourself wanting to type up multiple paragraphs, take a step back and think about ways in which you can keep this conversation shorter and simpler. Longer conversations aren't always better conversations.

### Common reactions to moderation

As you begin moderating, you might begin to notice patterns of community members responding to moderation in similar ways. You might also notice that certain interactions end quicker, simpler, with less stress on your end as a moderator.

1. Individuals ignoring moderation
    - Once an individual has been warned and notified of the rule they were breaking, don't feel like you have to go out of your way to communicate those unwilling to communicate themselves. 
1. Becoming defensive
    - Depending on the situation consider expressing your intent, and your role as a moderator as briefly and explicitly as possible. Don't hesitate to remind someone you're trying to make the community a safer, more welcoming place.
1. Acting confused
    - Try asking some short, simple questions.
1. Expressing genuine regret about infractions.
    - Express your appreciation that they're willing to listen and change their actions, and encourage these individuals to participate more in the server.
