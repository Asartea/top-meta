# Chat Moderators
_This document will serve as the entry point to chat moderation in The Odin Project's (TOP) Discord community for any new Core, Maintainers, and Moderators._

## Purpose of Moderator Role

Moderators are members of TOP staff that deal with moderating the official Discord server. Their main duty is to help ensure a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community for as many users as possible.

Both maintainers and moderators are autonomous groups when it comes down to their responsibilities. A maintainer isn't automatically a moderator and the reverse is also true,  although one can have both roles. A moderator should not communicate or act as if they were a maintainer even though they might possess more knowledge regarding plans for the curriculum or the platform. Those conversations can easily be passed on to our maintainer team mates.

### Admission and Removal of Role

Moderators, and those wishing to be considered for the Moderator role, are expected to have a history of regular and positive contributions to The Odin Project Discord community. Chat moderators are members of the community that illustrate and personify what it means to create a positive impact by abiding by the rules, extending help to others in regards to the community, having a willingness to hold both themselves and others accountable within the community, and motivating others to create a positive environment.

Removal of the role is subject to the discretion of the Core team members and may occur for any reason, including but not limited to: going against the [Social Contract](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/blob/main/staff-guidelines.md), violation of the rules, abuse of power, etc.

### Maintain, follow, and enforce rules

A moderator is expected to adhere to and uphold the rules and expectations as detailed and maintained in the `#rules` channel in the Discord or [in the community rules page on the TOP website](https://www.theodinproject.com/community_rules) at all times.
- The spirit of the rules is much more important to us than their exact wording.
- Be as lenient and forgiving as possible while making sure that repeat offenders don't overstay their welcome.
Keep in mind that most people break a rule simply because they are not aware of it being a rule. Most people are more than happy to correct their behaviour when told about our rules, without the need of a formal warning. This will be context dependent and some rule breaks are worse than others. The rules and guidelines should help with deciding on how best to proceed.
- Make use of the tools at your disposal: bots, private threads, role assignment and other Discord tools. Concrete workflows are documented internally.
- Follow the internal guidelines & culture on enforcing the rules. Help writing those down and maintaining them.
- Communicate with your fellow moderators when it comes to enforcing the rules and maintaining them. We're a team and the rules are how we communicate our expectations towards the community.

### Be part of the team

- Look after each other. You are not alone - make sure no one else on the team feels like they are. We're only as strong as the weakest amongst us.
- Look after yourself. This is not a job. You are a volunteer. You can and should expect support from the team. Communicate when you need support or a break.
- Provide generous feedback to people's moderation and moderation at large. We have lots to learn from each other and even when we agree, words of encouragement and support go a long way in becoming a confident moderator.
- Involve yourself with the rest of the TOP team - you might see what they don't in day-to-day interactions with users and can offer invaluable feedback on Discord's and TOP's direction.

### Follow the Social Contract
