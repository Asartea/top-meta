* Attendees: Eric, Bender, Briggs, Sully, Daniel, Marvin, Rachel, Tati, Xari
* Recording: 

## Agenda

- Discuss NodeJS Refresh (Tati)
    - Current course is like a code-along
    - Want to emphasise view templates *less* because of more modern tech and practices
        - client and server 
    - Outline on github, top-meta issue: #98
    - Briggs: like the idea, stay away from infrastructure
    - Bender: streams/buffers, ran into an issue with understanding a lib
        - simple project to take and process buffer, into some JSON or something
        - One area where "read the docs" are unhelpful 
    - Briggs: buffers/streams: seems like a CS concept rather than Node
    - Tati: Pairty should be top priority
        - there's post TOP options for other content passed parity
    - Sully: article on dev.to for streams/buffers as a compromise
    - Briggs: testing needs to be a part of this
    - Tati: end of Q2 goal, coinside with DB course
    
    - Action items
        - Interested people, check out node-refresh maintainer channel
        - Tati: Setup proposal and get information together
            - Eventually potentially pull in club-40

- Quick update on Style Guide Community Project (1-2 minutes) [Eric]
    - [Style Guide Issue](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/issues/105) for discussion
    - Eric update: 
        - style guide has recently been merged in, everyone writing new lessons should follow styleguide
        - issues on the meta repo to check out plan: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/issues/105
    - For this project, avoiding a handful of things, too nuanced over handling updating formatting things.
    - Ties into "improving link text" initative
    - Sully: should "link text" be in refactoring?
        - Eric: part of updating link-text would fit with the styleguide
    - Focusing on formatting over making sure "knowledge checks" are worded correctly
    - Daniel: Is this information going to be accessable to new maints?
        - Yes, will be in the contrubuting guide
    - Daniel: Will this be a part of a writing lesson guide?
        - Eric: *this* guide is for specific things like link formatting, codepen embeds, headings, etc 
  
- Briefly go over Contributing Guide, PR template, and Issue templates in our [CSS Exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) repo (<5 minutes) [Eric]
    - The plan is to make these items consistent across our repos
    - The curriculum and main TOP repos may need to be updated Wiki-wise as well
    - Discussion, if any, can be held in a thread
    - Contrubuting guide has been added to the css-exercises repo that could be potentially used across all repos
        - Including templates
    - Any user should be able to follow this guide
    - "how to contrubute" -> to help reduce load on the discord server
    - Briggs: do we need to copy-paste changes? 
        - Eric: yes, would need to be copy pasted on all duplicates
        - Briggs: Instead, use it in one place and only keep specific differences on individual repos
            - Could use a fresh repo, or the TOP site
        - Eric will think on it
    -  Will be linked in the PR templates and issue templates
    -  PR template isn't much different than current one
    -  Issue templates 
        - has default labels and other items
        - Important: There is a checkbox for being assigned an issue if they create it
        - Briggs: do we want to change verbage on checkbox to "I am working on this issue"
            - Maybe? The reason for not changing it is to prevent people from woking on things that we may not want
            - Sully: disagree, morale issues with letting people work on things and denying them
                - Briggs: want to ensure that we don't lose velocity because of our slowness to get to an issue
            - Daniel: personality types could be an issue, some will just just do it, some will want to wait
            - Daniel: Change to "I would like to be assigned this issue to work on it"
                - Agressive people will work on it anyway
                - Hesitent people will wait for approval
            - Changes got merged into bug_report.md 
    - TL;DR, this is for consistancy throughout the repos to make everything easier for people
    - Action Items: 
        - Eric: Move content to a central repo and link from supporting repos with nessessary modifications

- Bring up idea to "improve link text throughout the curriculum" [Zach/Eric/Sully]
    - Improve the existing link text in the curriculum to be more accessible
    - Potentially create a large opportunity like the knowledge checks overhaul
    - Give more meaningful names to links
        - instead of "click [here](here)", say "check out [MDN's article on closure]()"
    - This also ties into a11y issues
        - Sully: should we wait and do a full a11y pass?
        - two options
            - have it be part of the overall style project as it's tied into re-arranging links
            - community could be involved with updating link text as well as putting it in other sections
        - Eric will do this with the style guide thing
    - Plans on focusing on Foundations at first, then will focus on the courses in bursts
    - Briggs: May want to avoid updating lessons
        - Eric: important to update "NOW" rather than later
        - Worry about it when we get to that issue, foundations is a good start

- Discuss suggestions on club-40 mini-modding issue (<5 minutes) [Daniel]
    - Under Rule 1 actually state that community members should not attempt to moderate the chat themselves
    - Under Rule 1 indicate who moderators/maintainers actually are => (red/blue/orange)
    - For the FAQ add a featured question for "Who are the moderators on the TOP server?" => (red/blue/orange)
    - Also mention who is *not* the moderators (green color)
    - Action Items:
        - Briggs will edit the rules on the discord to explain the above

- Move rules to dyno [tati]
    - so Briggs doesn't have to maintain them
    - Yes, eventually.
