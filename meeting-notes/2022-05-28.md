- Mission Statement
    - Latest proposed statement is “Launch Software Careers” as a short and sweet message on what we are trying to do
    - The mission statement acts as an internal benchmark to weigh decisions against
    - When debating whether to add a new course or expand a testing section we can use the mission statement as a guideline on what decision would align with our goal
    - The mission statement also acts as an external indicator on the site in the About section for people to identify the mission of The Odin Project
    - Some concerns if the proposed mission statement “Launch Software Careers” might not be descriptive enough or work as a guideline on making course decisions (e.g. whether or not to add something like a Python course)
    - But people had previously argued longer mission statements could cause issues with defining a narrow direction that was too specific like “web developer” or “software engineer”
    - Suggestion to perhaps include “Engineering” as part of the mission statement
    - Could also just focus on “changing careers” and not mention “software”
    - Most on call prefer reference to “careers” instead of to “education” as focus of mission statement
    - Most on call do not want to include the word “free” as in “free curriculum”
    - Certain parts of the website, repos and curriculum (like within Foundations’ How This Course Will Work) might need to be revised to match our mission statement
    - We should not worry about edge cases like hobbyist learners that don’t align with the mission statement
    - We should have a separate Vision Statement alongside the Mission Statement
    - The Vision Statement could be both internal and external, more specific and focus on the future of Odin
    - We can wrap up the current Mission Statement and then focus on the Vision Statement, adjusting the former if necessary
    - If the Mission Statement focuses on launching software careers (beginners) then the Vision Statement could focus on advancing them (seniors)
    - The concept of an Odin Plus that includes advanced curriculum wouldn’t fit within a Mission Statement but could within a Vision Statement
    - **Summary of Action Items**
        - Set up a poll to vote on “Launch Software Careers” as a mission statement while acknowledging that it might be revised during the discussion of a Vision Statement 
        - Set up a new thread for discussion on the Vision Statement

- Future of Server Moderation
    - Initial discussion conducted but need more staff members to join this discussion
    - Idea to shift moderation to be an equal position rather than current hierarchy of Core > Maintainer > Moderator
    - Let Maintainer be people who focus on the site and the repos
    - Let Moderators be people who focus on the community/server
    - Does not mean a staff member cannot necessarily be both a Moderator and a Maintainer
    - If a staff member were to have both roles then that staff member should be properly onboarded for both of those roles. So a Moderator that then becomes a Maintainer should be onboarded for the Maintainer role. And a Maintainer that then becomes a Moderator should be onboarded for the Moderator role.
    - Proposed idea that only staff members of that role have a say in what that role does. This means a Maintainer who is not a Moderator would not have Moderation privileges in the Discord server, or visibility over the Mod chat channels. Just as Moderators do not have visibility over the Maintainer chat channels or merge privileges on GitHub
    - Proposed idea to follow the Ownership Model
    - Proposed idea to create a Staff role (@staff) so every staff member can be pinged, to create a feeling of everyone being part of a full team, and could make everyone the same role color
    - Proposed idea to create a Staff Lounge chat channel for Moderators and Maintainers to share and to remove the existing off topic chat channels for those individual roles in an effort to bring the whole staff together
    - Currently the average Maintainer has more experience within the community than the average Moderator, the Moderator team might need some extra leadership from existing Maintainers who take on that additional role
    - Moderators could have a leadership group made up of either existing Moderators and existing Maintainers 
    - Voice/video business meetings for the whole staff (Moderators and Maintainers together) should occur once per month
    - Could follow a model of having 1 Moderator meeting per month, 1 Maintainer meeting per month and 1 whole staff (Moderator and Maintainer) meeting per month
    - Core team needs to discuss some of these suggestions internally and look back to past experience within this community to offer input on these ideas
    - More staff members are needed but before doing so decisions need to be made about the Moderation Matrix and the onboarding process for Moderators
    - Some suggestions to slow down the influx of new staff members so we avoid too many new members at once. Could also ease new staff members into staff privileges
    - Suggestion for no more than 1 new moderator per month period and another suggestion for no more than 2-3 new moderators per month period
    - The moderator team could recruit new Moderators themselves and onboard/train them
    - Concern that Maintainers might need to have some moderator privileges for dealing with emergency server situations when no Moderators are online (e.g. Nitro spam)
    - For any new Moderator Leadership group, the current Moderators need to have a say in who that leadership is
    - Moderators could elect leaders and Core could confirm; or Core could elect leaders and Moderators could confirm; or Moderators could both elect and confirm without Core
    - **Summary of Action Items**
        - A voice/video business meeting of the whole staff (Moderators and Maintainers) will be set up to discuss these ideas together before any major decisions are made
        - The Core members will internally discuss the idea of unifying into one whole staff
