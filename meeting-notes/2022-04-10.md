# Odin Mid Month Meeting 

* Date: 2022-04-10
* Attendees: Alex, Briggs, Carlos, Daniel, Eric, Kevin, Leo K, Marvin, Rachel, Sully, Tati, Zach
* Recording: Daniel

## Agenda

- Discuss a rough idea regarding assigning reviewers to PRs [Eric]
    - Get people's thoughts on what would be more an "opt-in" thing (those who don't like/want it wouldn't be affected)
    - Would most likely need to be brought up again in a meeting with more in attendance to get more feedback/level of interest
- Discuss moving to an issue-first approach [Eric]
    - I.e., every PR should be attached to a PR, rather than people just opening PRs for simple things
- 

## Minutes

- Assigning Reviewers to PRs
  - Idea proposed and agreed to for assigning reviewers to PRs
  - Opt in, not mandatory
  - Might help when we get a big influx of PRs and also help more people get involved in reviewing
  - Specific reviewers can be assigned, if they cannot do the PR then the appropriate group will be pinged
  - This gives people a chance to step out of their comfort zone while still being able to default to the group if needed
  - We will set up groups for different paths (Foundations, Ruby, JS, and possibly Getting Hired)
  - Carlos will look into setting up teams on GitHub 
  - Carlos will make a Google Doc for signups and will ping all maintainers later this week
  - When someone is assigned for a PR review, ping them in the #review-requests channel as well in case they don’t get notifications from GitHub
  - Eric can help with assigning reviewers soon when has more time
  - Marvin can use Dyno bot to do scheduled reminders (like once per week) that pings @maintainers to be proactive with reviewing
  - Some possible bot solutions: https://wiki.dyno.gg/en/modules/automessage, https://github.com/kentaro-m/auto-assign, https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewer-lottery
  - Possibly have 2 people do reviews as required. Small change / easy PRs don’t require 2 reviewers
  - **Summary of Action Items** Carlos will set up a Google Docs for team signups and configure teams on GitHub. Marvin will add reminders to Dyno bot for pinging maintainers on reviewing. Eric will volunteer to help with assigning reviewers.

- Rule to attach issues to a PR
  - The group was overall against the idea of a rule that would require issues being attached to PRs  
  - The idea would be to help prevent dupes, but this might not be a solvable problem
  - It might discourage people from making simple changes (typos, link fixes)
  - Adds extra overhead and people might still get it wrong
  - Would sometimes take more time to make a new issue and wait to get assigned than it takes to just do the PR

- Reminders on how to contribute (small fixes)
  - Add a little guide within Foundations that can point out easiest paths to making a contribution when a learner notices something wrong (typos, broken links, etc.)
  - The guide could go in the Git section of Foundations and reminders could be within the start of the Ruby and JS paths
  - Can explain how learners can use the “improve this lesson link” for easy fixes and that for bigger fixes they should make an issue
  - Marvin looking into a bot response in the #suggestions-bugs channel
  - The bot can be a permanent sticky (like in #creations-showcase) that reminds members that for small issues like XYZ, just go make a PR as well as link to the contributing guide or Foundations lesson that features how to contribute
  - Can also improve visibility of the “improve this lesson” button by moving it to the side navigation (jump links with Introduction, Lesson Overview, etc.) and making it stand out / bold but without the link making learner lose their spot on the scroll 
  - **Summary of Action Items** Marvin will look into a bot response for #suggestions-bugs channel. Kevin will look into a side navigation implementation of the improve this lesson feature. A guide/paragraph on making small contributions will be needed within Foundations along with reminders.
