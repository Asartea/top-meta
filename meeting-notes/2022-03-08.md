## Minutes

- Did not go through idea funnel since most items were high impact and need to be discussed at the main monthly meeting

- Style Guide Update
  - Issue template has a good base on what to create
  - Eric will get some community members involved for contributions

- Discord Pronouns
  - A community member asked about using a Discord bot for listing user pronouns
  - Very brief discussion but no action taken

- Code Review Event on Discord
  - Daniel, Leo K., and MacDaniel are meeting to discuss an idea for a code review event that has come out of the Clean Code Bookclub
  - After they meet the idea will be presented at a future maintainer meeting

- Rule Discussion: No Politics
  - Not opposed to people making value based claims relevant to tech or the server
  - Moderation should occur based on the situation rather than a hard stop against anything seen as “political”
  - If a topic is relevant to the server (e.g. related to programming, tech industry, getting hired) then it should be allowed for discussion as long as it is not inflammatory in nature
  - Action Item: Revise rules to indicate that something likely to be inflammatory will likely be moderated
  - Action Item: Update the TOP-Meta ideas with discussion on no politics rule
  - Moderators will need to use discretion but that is part of the job. Not everything can be cut and dry
  - Add language to current politics rule that is akin to “If you aren’t sure if a topic would be inflammatory or a rule violation, use the ModMail to ask first if you can bring the topic up in chat”
  - Community members who read through the rules and ask through ModMail first probably won’t be bringing up inflammatory discussions themselves. But it’s the other community members who don’t read rules or ask first that are likely to cause problems
  - **Summary of Action Items:** Marvin will update discussion on TOP-Meta, No Politics rule will be updated with verbiage on not introducing inflammatory topics and advising community members to use ModMail first if they aren't sure whether a topic is inflammatory or a rule violation

- Foundations Course Refresh
  - Potential refresh to Foundations to make it a proper path with sections split up
  - Would there be a problem with too many lessons between the projects? Say 15 small lessons on JavaScript before getting to Rock Paper Scissors
  - There would be practice sections / assignments along the way before the projects
  - More lessons with less content per lesson. So instead of one lesson covering 2 or 3 topics, each lessons gets its own topic
  - Additional projects could be added along the way, e.g. a JS project before Rock Paper Scissors

- Practice Section vs. Assignment Section
  - A community member on Discord believed that the CSS exercises under the Practice section was optional instead of required
  - Learners seem to view the Practice section differently than Assignment section
  - Revisit combining the Practice section into the Assignment section
  - In previous discussion, Cody had brought up the point that Practice was for doing things and Assignment was for reading
  - But other lessons and new DB lessons are using Assignment section to have learners do stuff
  - The term “Practice” as a section header is likely making learners think they can skip it if they don’t think they need the practice
  - Maintainers on call in favor of having Practice section fall under Assignment section
  - **Summary of Action Items:** Daniel will ping Cody in the bumped thread on Practice vs Assignment and restart the conversation. After further discussion can ping @maintainer @core so everybody sees conversation. If Practice moves to Assignments, Eric will update the style guide accordingly

- Git Lessons
  - Git lessons are basically done
  - One more PR needed to remove old location of lessons from curriculum
  - If placement of lessons needs to be changed then it can be changed
